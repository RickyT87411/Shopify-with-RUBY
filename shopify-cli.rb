      Congratulations, you've successfully installed Shopify CLI 3!

      Global installations of Shopify CLI 3 should only be used to work on Shopify
      themes. To learn about the changes to theme workflows in this version, refer

      If you want to keep using Shopify CLI 2, then you can install it again using
      `brew install shopify-cli@2` and run commands using the `shopify2` program
      name (for example, `shopify2 theme push` and `shopify2 extension push`).
      Note however that Shopify CLI 2 will be sunset on May 31, 2023.
